<h2>Introduction to Generative AI </h2>
<h3>What is Generative AI</h3> 
Generative AI is a subsection of Artificial Intelligence that can create new content based on existing data. (JP Morgan) Generative AI looks to create new content for users that can help them across many fields such as content creation, data analysis, and marketing. The use of AI can help in many different applications that are significantly cheaper than any other options. It is far more efficient than any human can ever be and is rapidly growing into the future. As it is able to solve more complex problems each day it is used and being further developed. The main difference between generative Ai and Traditional AI is the application they provide, Traditional AI looks to analyze data and make predictions. Where Generative AI is more capable and is able to create new data sets using the input and existing language. Gathering past data to create new ideas from the data generating new content and using existing knowledge to develop new content. 
<h3>Advantages of using Generative AI</h3>
There are many different advantages of using Generative AI such as cost and efficiency. This is seen throughout all offers it has such as creating code, image generation, writing, and data analytics. It is able to offer very quick solutions to problems with ease and can be used by anyone helping limit many expenses in a company or group. Generative AI is also extremely helpful when looking to elaborate on other work such as writing and coding. AI is able to quickly develop a solution to a problem or edit that a person wrote, helping further their work and allowing less errors in human work. It becomes an extremely useful tool when helping humans create more perfect work.   
<h3>Disadvantages of Generative AI</h3> 
Although there are many useful applications in Generative AI models, it's not perfect. There are many instances of “Hallucination” in Generative AI where the model will straight away from the data it has and make something up that is inaccurate using what it has from its data. This can create a massive problem in using the system that would require the use of a human to check the content and make sure it is on track. Another massive issue with generative AI is they run the risk of copyright infringement as they often repeat the data they have stored to create the generative content the software produces. As the only intelligence they have comes from previous data that is stored in the system.
